threading: win32-pthread...maybe... :)

libvpx
  fix, update blog/ML
    threading/configure?

check march=native (from laptop...)
  ffmpeg more? do I need to enable runtime detection when it's not? 
  libx264 still uses i686?

cleanup zeranoe suggs (vpx?)

more libraries
  All the current builds'
  compile orc/schroedinger/forum
  
initially assert they have git and gcc and autoconf libtool installed...

parameters to the script
  an option to setup-compilers --arch

warn that we're not using it if they already have a toolchain in the PATH

support external toolchains
  then support "checking if they already have zlib installed"

--enable-none --enable-x264 --enable-all-gpl --enable-all-non-free

--extra-ffmpeg-options

"shared" builds option, like libavcodec-54.dll

libflite is too big?

== maybe/never do ==

march=native vpx (others?)

dynamic aac somehow...prolly for something with > 2 audios...

see if it "builds ok" 64 bit with out the path or ABI thing

cleanup ramiro suggested for libgsm

test timings for first failure commits bisect-like[?]
  test really old with -threads 6...

does it affect "both" libx264 and/or just ffmpeg?
    Also, I wonder if x264 needs to be recompiled after every update to
    test? Does this issue root in FFmpeg or x264 possibly?

--disable-decoder=libvpx ?

not require prompts at all for the compiler
try and figure out if its pthreads that's giving me the speedup over his

profile guided builds?
  major libs
  everything

other "-march" like options? fastmath

use make -j 2 (more than one core)

x264 fomit frame pointer for 32 bit?
