== actual todos ==

decklink?

windows cygwin batch file to build the whole thing?
  can I do this all with that zeranoe .bat file and cygwin deps? LOL

== maybe/never do, more on the never ==

dvdnav os x

not use the "default lib" directory I guess, if that enables us to build versions for linux instead, easily, and as well [except nobody has even once requested that...?]?

fix mplayer build :|

also can it skip rebuilding ffmpeg every time, huh wuh? reconfigure too, if the ffmpeg build failed?

auto detect new release versions of dependencies [that are active LOL]

vlc tell them they don't do make parallel right for doze...if I can ever repro it...

libav build broken [do I care enough though?]

mplayer use svn trunk?

vlc use git master?

test out mplayer with its record-size stuff...

final install of ffmpeg static to some folder etc. [?] yeah why not...

vlc build is dead with his pthreads? mine?
  I prefer his anyway if that way does work better...how can I have mine here tho?
  SHARED was hiding the linnnnnk error far far away...and also not even needing it...but should have failed on dll...unless I never used it!

real distro/installer/put it online
  release "debug" builds, full static linkable builds [?]

ask the x264 guys what is a good fprofiled option out there...

were there any other places with suspect non march stuff?

native windows'ify it
  then some download with all of it?

linux VM download with all of it

add 10040 to their error message translator

https://github.com/qyot27/mpv/blob/extra-new/DOCS/crosscompile-mingw-tedious.txt lists some more dependencies, some of which even work with FFmpeg.  Some might work with Mplayer.  Might as well add them, right?

don't ffmpeg enable runtime cpu detect for march cases? [meh, just for a smaller binary? or does it make it faster?]

clean sandbox build all with libfdk [i.e. can it still build everything everything?] 

march without runtime cpu with hard core 1GB y4m fprofiled x264 and amd/intel cpu specified...LOLyeah...ask sherpya if he gets any speedups.

complain to vlc you can't build multi thread make :P

tell mingw-w64 that they should support VARIANT

use libcaca git instead, tell them it still isn't enough...

test all things dvd to make sure they play anything...

mplayer git'ify'
  blocked'ish by lack of easy access to their source

vlc git'ify
  hopefully no longer blocked, but I'm not pointed at mainline yet... :P

-d should auto select "both 32 and 64 bit" [XXX make it into command line param too?]

command line option "don't update any git repos"

libav work with nonfree? meh

figure out how av_export workz with shared, to be able to tell so and so...
  my guess is that it works with ffmpeg because the .lib files instruct it to use a dll? huhwuh?
    ok you've got ffmpeg built static, and then .dll.lib.a files, right?  so thiiis is a different import structure than pthreads uses, and allows you to use "uni .h" files.......so maybe pthreads win32 should be generating different .lib files or something?
  so ffmppeg maybe it creates the .lib.dll.a file different, and so *that* one can work...there may be a way to get it to work

don't "always install libavcodec" [only when building VLC, maybe only ffmpeg too]
  or smaller?

VLC, you should use ../plugins/accessibility [?]
  you should also not use plugins [?]
  after investigate more, does it use them now? meh

complain on anybody that I have to sed their .pc files [yikes!]

  check for any other configs zeranoe uses?

fix all that are hard coded revision checkouts...meh

SDL check if has same bug with 2.0, if so then file it...

Qt check if same weirdness with 5.1, if so then file it...

it should notice when configure was originally from some other git commit...anyway today, if you go to ffmpeg, checkout a different branch, it doesn't reconfigure...

x264 pkg-config should specify -libpthread? (repro by compiling ffmpeg with windows threads, you'll see...)
  tell them? others that require tweaks also?

out only real speedup hopes: configure ffmpeg --cpu, libx264 profile guided <sigh>
  make march work with ffmpeg/x264
   compare speeds, plus 64 vs 32 bit for everything
  then with profiled LOL

tell those that fail with multi-threaded make

distribute "my own set of [I guess optimized?] binaries" that are processor optimized (if it even matters speed-wise LOL).
  though mine do have pthreads...but hopefully I can test and report and get the zeranoe ones built that way...share the workload :)
  move all downloads to some place I control...maybe even "all" downloads LOL
    old downloads to sourceforge [?]

a distro that's a VM they can just open up and hit "go" in :)

ask a pkg-config mailing list?

make it compilable on windows native...
  release a downloadable "click here to run it" to build full libfdk-aac on windows LOL

release "some 10 bit, some not" ?
  command line?

release some compiler optimized? does it make a difference? real installer?
  ancient debug builds, etc...hmm...sourceforge for legacy? yeah

add openmp, for libsoxr? (any other dependency?)

test fribidi git master (does 0.19.5 fail? it should?) with wine installed

tell orc+schro "you didn't well cross compile!"

more march stuff...today we have the namsy pamsy enable cpu detection stuffs :P

calculate size of each piece, put it on a wiki somewhere...
  startup slowdown, too?

support external toolchains
  then support "checking if they already have zlib installed into it"

--enable-none --enable-x264 --enable-all-gpl --enable-all-non-free

cleanup ramiro suggested for libgsm [?]

profile guided builds?
  major libs
  everything

other "-march" like options? fastmath? f full program?
  x264 fomit frame pointer for 32 bit?

qt seemed to infer too much about the cpu [possibly?]

somewhere mentioned the old "-fwhole-project" setting again somewhere LOL hmm...for optimizing x264 possibly?

TWOLAME move to .pc?
