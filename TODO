== actual todos ==

fix vlc... :| then patch for DVD :)
poor audio sdl ffplay something?
try more march, does it really even matter?
  compare with gcc 4.9.3 ?? grr

nvidia build various :)

nvresize build

add cygwin "cygwin bash" prompt [and combine...]

add LGPL to the normal releases, why not? (shared and static)

release fei0r filters

== maybe/never do, more on the never... ==

XP mingwex?
test out mplayer with its record-size whatever...
fix gsm shared is broken...that was painful...

opencl support [copy in headers?] https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/ it needs something to link against too...ai ai
  I doubt you can use the kronos stuff but maybe...
  apparently "hard" http://oscarbg.blogspot.com/2009/12/opencl-with-mingw.html but possible, but https://streamcomputing.eu/blog/2015-03-16/how-to-install-opencl-on-windows/ says just to download the drivers still :|
  or maybe just use the most basic version and is ok? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Headers/opencl12/opencl.h

figure out real static linkable builds [tell zeranoe to put them on his site?]
  linkable against them with mingw, msvc...

libav.pc is missing myriad things [patches to ffmpeg-core?]
  then use it in x264 LOL wait isn't that circular...ok maybe this is low prio

add more executables like the jb-alvarado one [?] meh

not use the "default lib" directory I guess, if that enables us to build versions for linux instead, easily, and as well...except shouldn't they use their own dep system? I guess it might still be convenient...awaiting more demand...

auto detect new release versions of dependencies [that are active LOL]

mplayer use svn trunk?

final install of ffmpeg static to some folder etc. [?] yeah why not...
  and .exe distro LOL

real distro/installer/put it online
  release "debug" builds, full static linkable builds [?]

ask the x264 guys what is a good fprofiled option out there...

were there any other places with suspect non -march stuff?

linux VM download with all of it

https://github.com/qyot27/mpv/blob/extra-new/DOCS/crosscompile-mingw-tedious.txt lists some more dependencies, some of which even work with FFmpeg.  Some might work with Mplayer.  Might as well add them, right?

don't ffmpeg enable runtime cpu detect for march cases? [meh, just for a smaller binary? or does it make it faster?]

clean sandbox build all with libfdk [i.e. can it still build everything everything?] 

march without runtime cpu with hard core 1GB y4m fprofiled x264 and amd/intel cpu specified...LOLyeah...ask sherpya if he gets any speedups.

use libcaca git instead, tell them it still isn't enough...
  https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1391 also tell them non windows xp? also tell mingw-w64 what?

test all things dvd to make sure they play anything...


-d should auto select "both 32 and 64 bit" [XXX make it into command line param too?]

command line option "don't update any git repos"

complain on anybody that I have to sed their .pc files [yikes!]

  check for any other configs zeranoe uses?

fix all that are hard coded revision checkouts...meh

SDL check if has same configure bug with 2.0, if so then file it...

Qt check if same weirdness with 5.1, if so then file it...

it should notice when configure was originally from some other git commit...anyway today, if you go to ffmpeg, checkout a different branch, it doesn't reconfigure...

x264 pkg-config should specify -libpthread? (repro by compiling ffmpeg with windows threads, you'll see...)
  tell them? others that require tweaks also?

out only real speedup hopes: configure ffmpeg --cpu, libx264 profile guided <sigh>
  make march work with ffmpeg/x264
   compare speeds, plus 64 vs 32 bit for everything
  then with profiled LOL

tell those that fail with multi-threaded make

distribute "my own set of [I guess optimized?] binaries" that are processor optimized (if it even matters speed-wise LOL).
  though mine do have pthreads...but hopefully I can test and report and get the zeranoe ones built that way...share the workload :)
  move all downloads to some place I control...maybe even "all" downloads LOL
    old downloads to sourceforge [?]

a distro that's a VM they can just open up and hit "go" in :)

make it compilable on windows native...
  release a downloadable "click here to run it" to build full libfdk-aac on windows LOL

release "some 10 bit, some not" ?
  command line?

release some compiler optimized? does it make a difference? real installer?
  ancient debug builds, etc...hmm...sourceforge for legacy? yeah

add openmp, for libsoxr? (any other dependency?)

test fribidi git master (does 0.19.5 fail? it should?) with wine installed

tell orc+schro "you didn't well cross compile!"

calculate size of each piece, put it on a wiki somewhere...
  startup slowdown, too?

support external toolchains
  then support "checking if they already have zlib installed into it"

--enable-none --enable-x264 --enable-all-gpl --enable-all-non-free

profile guided builds?
  major libs
  everything

other "-march" like options? fastmath? f full program?
  x264 fomit frame pointer for 32 bit?

qt seemed to infer too much about the cpu [possibly?]

somewhere mentioned the old "-fwhole-project" setting again somewhere LOL hmm...for optimizing x264 possibly?
